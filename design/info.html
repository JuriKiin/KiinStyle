    <div class="font-text font-md l-height-25">
        <p>Creating responsive design with KiinStyle is easy. <span class='bold'>Every class in the library exists with a mobile counterpart.</span></p>
        <p>This means that if your design requires different styling on smaller screens, you can customize its appearance.</p>
        <p>This is done by prefixing any style with <span class="code">m-</span>.</p>

        <p>Take the below example. The following code creates the below element:</p>
        <p class="code scroll-hidden">&lt;p class="font-lg pad-10p bg-sand snow height-75"&gt;This is a test paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

        <p class="font-lg pad-10p bg-sand snow height-75">This is a test paragraph.</p>
    
        <p>On a desktop, this might look okay, however on a mobile device, the height of this element might take up too much space.</p>
        <p>In order to fix this, we can make use of the <span class='code'>m-</span> prefix, and set a new height for smaller screens:</p>

        <p>Taking the above example, let's lower the height to something more reasonable by using <span class='code'>m-height-20</span>.</p>
        <p class="italic">The full HTML declaration now looks like this:</p>
        <p class="code scroll-hidden">&lt;p class="font-lg pad-10p bg-sand snow height-75 m-height-20"&gt;This is a test paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

        <p>You can see that we keep the same <span class='code'>height-75</span> that we want for wider screens, but now add the additional class <span class='code'>m-height-20</span>.</p>
        <p>If you now look at the below UI element on a smaller screen, you'll notice that it takes on the smaller height, making it better.</p>

        <p class="font-lg pad-10p bg-sand snow height-75 m-height-20">This is a test paragraph.</p>

        <p class="italic">If you are looking at this page on a computer screen, the two elements likely look the same. This is because the <span class='code'>m-</span> prefix only applies on smaller screens.</p>
    
        <p class="bold">It's important to remember that the <span class='code'>m-</span> prefix can be applied to any style that you wish to change for smaller screens.</p>
