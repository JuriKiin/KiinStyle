    <h1 class="font-lg font-header">Introducing... Responsive Design.</h1>
    <p class="margin-left-5 font-text font-md l-height-50 m-l-height-25">Ever since the beginning of KiinStyle, the
        main issue has been a lack of responsive design.<br>
        Due to the nature of the framework, there hasn't been a way to design sites for mobile.<br>
        This has been a major issue with KiinStyle, however with this update, it is changed.<br>
        KiinStyle already decreases font sizes for smaller screens, but no other styles are effected.<br>
        With the current process, the way to style elements exists as follows:<br>
    <p class="code scroll-hidden pad-20p align-center">&lt;p class="font-lg pad-10p bg-sand snow height-75"&gt;This
        is a test paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
    <p class="font-lg pad-10p bg-sand snow height-75">This is a test paragraph.</p>

    <p class="margin-left-5 font-text font-md l-height-50 m-l-height-25">The issue here, is when you scale the
        screen smaller, or view it on mobile, the height becomes too big for the platform.<br>
        In order to solve this, KiinStyle is introducing the m- system.<br>
        For any style that you want to style differently on mobile, simply add an additional class with m- in
        front.<br>
        In this example, we are changing the height value to smaller on mobile. (Adding m-height-20)</p>
    <p class="code align-center pad-20p scroll-hidden">&lt;p class="font-lg pad-10p bg-sand snow height-75
        m-height-20"&gt;This is a test paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
    <p class="font-lg pad-10p bg-sand snow height-75 m-height-20">This is a test paragraph.</p>

    <p class="margin-left-5 font-text font-md l-height-50 m-l-height-25">You'll notice that this page decreases the
        line height of paragraph tags when on smaller screens.</p>
    <p class="margin-left-5 font-text font-md l-height-50 m-l-height-25">The m- system can be used on any style that
        exists in the KiinStyle Framework. Enjoy!</p>
